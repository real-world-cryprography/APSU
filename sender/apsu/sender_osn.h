        /**
        The Sender class implements all necessary functions to create and send parameter, OPRF,
        and PSU or labeled PSU queries (depending on the sender), and process any responses
        received. Most of the member functions are static, but a few (related to creating and
        processing the query itself) require an instance of the class to be created.

        The class includes two versions of an API to performs the necessary operations. The "simple"
        API consists of three functions: Sender::RequestParams, Sender::RequestOPRF, and
        Sender::request_query. However, these functions only support network::NetworkChannel, such
        as network::ZMQChannel, for the communication. Other channels, such as
        network::StreamChannel, are only supported by the "advanced" API.

        The advanced API requires many more steps. The full process is as follows:

        (0 -- optional) Sender::CreateParamsRequest must be used to create a parameter request.
        The request must be sent to the sender on a channel with network::Channel::send. The sender
        must respond to the request and the response must be received on the channel with
        network::Channel::receive_response. The received Response object must be converted to the
        right type (ParamsResponse) with the to_params_response function. This function will return
        nullptr if the received response was not of the right type. A PSUParams object can be
        extracted from the response.

        (1) A Sender object must be created from a PSUParams object. The PSUParams must match what
        the sender uses.

        (2) Sender::CreateOPRFReceiver must be used to process the input vector of items and
        return an associated oprf::OPRFReceiver object. Next, Sender::CreateOPRFRequest must be
        used to create an OPRF request from the oprf::OPRFReceiver, which can subsequently be sent
        to the sender with network::Channel::send. The sender must respond to the request and the
        response must be received on the channel with network::Channel::receive_response. The
        received Response object must be converted to the right type (OPRFResponse) with the
        to_oprf_response function. This function will return nullptr if the received response was
        not of the right type. Finally, Sender::ExtractHashes must be called with the
        OPRFResponse and the oprf::OPRFReceiver object. This function returns
        std::pair<std::vector<HashedItem>, std::vector<LabelKey>>, containing the OPRF hashed items
        and the label encryption keys. Both vectors in this pair must be kept for the next steps.

        (3) Sender::create_query (non-static member function) must then be used to create the
        query itself. The function returns std::pair<Request, IndexTranslationTable>, where the
        Request object contains the query itself to be send to the sender, and the
        IndexTranslationTable is an object associated to this query describing how the internal data
        structures of the query maps to the vector of OPRF hashed items given to
        Sender::create_query. The IndexTranslationTable object is needed later to process the
        responses from the sender. The Request object must be sent to the sender with
        network::Channel::send. The received Response object must be converted to the right type
        (QueryResponse) with the to_query_response function. This function will return nullptr if
        the received response was not of the right type. The QueryResponse contains only one
        important piece of data: the number of ResultPart objects the sender should expect to
        receive from the sender in the next step.

        (4) network::Channel::receive_result must be called repeatedly to receive all ResultParts.
        For each received ResultPart Sender::process_result_part must be called to find a
        std::vector<MatchRecord> representing the match data associated to that ResultPart.
        Alternatively, one can first retrieve all ResultParts, collect them into a
        std::vector<ResultPart>, and use Sender::process_result to find the complete result --
        just like what the simple API returns. Both Sender::process_result_part and
        Sender::process_result require the IndexTranslationTable and the std::vector<LabelKey>
        objects created in the previous steps.
